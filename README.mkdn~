ACSOP
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get familiar with 
[Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the ACSOP trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/ACSOP/android.git -b ics

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Please note that this repo is currently an un-modified AOSP android-4.0.4_r1.2 branch.
